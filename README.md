### ABSTRACT ###

In this study, clustering methods were comprehensively evaluated on five different datasets—Wine, Glass, Adult Income, Breast Cancer,
and Indian Diabetes—using the Python programming language.
K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering algorithms were applied, and different parameter configurations for DBSCAN and Hierarchical 
Clustering were tested to determine the optimal settings. he performance of the K-Means and Fuzzy C-Means algorithms was analyzed using clustering validity 
metrics such as the Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, Calinski-Harabasz Index, Partition Coefficient, and Partition Entropy. 
The results were examined to determine the optimal numberof clusters for each dataset. This study highlights the effectiveness of the clustering algorithms on
different data structures, the comprehensiveness of the applied clustering validity metrics, and the importance of parameter optimization processes.

##Some graphs randomly from all datasets were attached:
